description:
 This check monitors the voltages provided by the power supply and CMOS
 battery of servers via a LENOVO XClarity Controller (XCC). It uses
 snmp and the LENOVO XCC MIB to gather the data.

 The check uses the lower and upper warning and critical levels extracted
 from the device (OIDs {voltCritLimitLow}, {voltNonCritLimitLow},
 {voltCritLimitHigh} ,{voltNonCritLimitHigh}) to calculate the state of
 the service.

inventory:
 The service discovery will find one service per voltage measurement channel

item:
 The name of the power supply measurement channel as extracted from the OID {voltDescr}
